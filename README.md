# gitcredential

Simple utility to create git credential entry for file store helper from
command line. 

Personally I use this to setup a credential file to be used within
Continous Integration server based on a vagrant VM. 

The credentials to a git repository that is accessed from within the VM is
provided via a shared `credentails.git` file that I create with this
utility.
